# Rotation Algorithms

Rotation Forest and Rotation AdaBoost implementations in Python with a full Scikit-Learn compatibility.

Rotation Forest algorithm from the paper Rodr√≠guez et al. "Rotation Forest: A New Classifier Ensemble Method". 

Rotation AdaBoost is a novel algorithm which combines ideas from Rotation Forest and AdaBoost algorithm. Particularly, it is the known boosting procedure with some specific rotations on each iteration. The algorithm has been developed by Anton Goy, the student of the Lomonosov Moscow State Unversity.
